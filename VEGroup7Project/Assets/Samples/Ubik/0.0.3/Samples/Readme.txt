The Samples folder demonstrates how to use the CVE.

The Introduction folder is where to start. It contains the Hello World room, and environments showing off what the CVE can do.

The Minimal folder contains minimal working examples. These show how to achieve specific goals, such as spawning objects, audio chat and discovery, in isolation, so you can see how they work without being confused by extraneous functionality.

The Applications folder contains fully working games and experiments showing how the parts can be put together to make a complete experience.

The Assets folder contains various assets used by the samples. All of the assets are CC0, meaning you can re-use them as you wish, including in closed source & commercial products.
